      <h1>Conference Tracks</h1>
      <p>The theme for this conference is “New Beginnings”. The world has just faced a pandemic and continues to face
        mounting crises and uncertainty. More than ever, digital games need to contribute to bringing cultures and
        generations together. This edition of FDG also marks something of a new beginning since this is the first time
        FDG will be held in Spring instead of in the Fall. FDG 2023’s theme of New Beginnings is all about challenging
        current practices in user studies, game technology, game design and evaluation, reaching deeper understandings
        of user experiences, and fostering better representation and inclusivity in playable media. Generally, “New
        Beginnings” in FDG also means valuing contributions such as surveys and meta-reviews of past work and can work
        as a framing for vision papers related to the current and future societal and cultural needs.</p>

      <h2>Topics</h2>
      <h3>Technical Game Development, Novel Controllers</h3>
      <p>This track is for research that advances game development practices. This track is suitable for papers on game
        engines, frameworks, computer graphics techniques, rendering, animation, networking, novel interaction
        techniques (such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and alternate controllers) and other technical areas.
        Furthermore, the submission of work focusing on the development of novel hardware interfaces are also welcome.
        This track focuses on the technological aspects of game development and offers a venue for researchers and
        developers to share technological advancements of the field. Please consider that papers that focus more on
        Artificial Intelligence, or Player Analytics should be submitted in their respective tracks.</p>

      <h3>Game Design, Studio Practices, Novel Mechanics, Novel Experiences</h3>
      <p>This track is for papers that examine, validate, and refute game making practices, patterns, mechanics,
        dynamics, or aesthetics. This track also favors alternative methods of game design, practical examinations of
        user-testing protocols, exploration of alternative controllers, study on human-computer interaction in games and
        the empirical analysis of game-making processes, and more. Methods in submissions can include case studies, A/B
        testing, literature reviews, comparative analysis, and other appropriate efforts. This track focuses on game
        design and the influence of games, their mechanics or alternative controller systems on players, and different
        methods for playtesting.</p>

      <h3>Game Analytics and Visualization</h3>
      <p>This track invites authors to submit research related to data science, analytics, and game data visualization,
        as well as analyzing player behavior. Techniques such as player modeling, churn analysis, player profiling,
        business intelligence and performance evaluation or workflow optimization applied to the field of digital games,
        are all suitable submissions for this track. Submissions spanning across quantitative, qualitative, and mixed
        method approaches are also encouraged. Novel methodological approaches are valued in this track. Examples of
        encouraged and valued submissions include game data visualization; behavioral analysis (or other) game data;
        advances in methodological approaches that analyze and/or visualize game data; application or expanding novel
        statistical methods; machine learning such as deep learning, clustering, or other AI algorithms; game data
        mining; and novel visualization and analytical methods for game data.</p>

      <h3>Game Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>This track focuses on the many applications of computational and artificial intelligence to the design, play,
        development, and improvement of games, as well as autonomous game testing. Relevant topics for submissions in
        this track include general game-playing AI, procedural and player-driven content generation, mixed-initiative
        authoring tools, computational narrative, believable agents, multi-agent systems and AI assisted game design.
        This track also encourages authors to push the boundaries of autonomous content generation such as game content
        orchestration, procedural game assets (e.g., audio, graphics, or game mechanics), computational creativity and
        affective computing within the context of digital games. This track focuses on more experimental technically
        driven aspects of game development, such as developing algorithms capable of automating certain aspects of
        games, systems that dynamically influence certain aspects of play or tools that actively help developers during
        the development process.</p>
